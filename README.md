# discord-hangouts

Version of Donut for discord, built as a bot in python.

All I learned from this project is that the Discord API is really confusing to use.

### Current Feature Set

Currently, the project is built specifically for the Reboot Fellowship 2022 Group in Discord (don't we love personalized software?)

The two functions are

- "testing content" which checks if the bot is up
- "make hangouts" which lists every pair of users in a channel and then matches them together in a DM channel
